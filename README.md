# Arduino-Snippets 

![Arduino-Logo](/arduino_logo.png?raw=true)

### About
This repository contains snippets of code that I use for
development using Arduino and ESP8266. This includes different 
library usages of different electronic sensors, actuators,
external program connections and APIs that I made so I won't 
write it again  from scratch if I needed it for other purposes. 
This will make my development for other projects faster since I 
will just refer to the snippets I made previously.

This does not contain complete projects but only a "snippet" 
that can be used for bigger projects in the future.
